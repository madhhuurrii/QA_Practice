## Selenium + TestNG Framework

### Test Automation Framework
A set of guidelines like coding standards, test data handling, object repository etc. which when followed during automation scripting produce beneficial outcomes reusage, reduce maintainence etc. 
These are just guidelines and not rules; they are not mandatory u can still script w/o following guidelines. but will miss out on advantage of framework.

- Selenium webdriver is used as a core automation engine
- Eclipse IDE is used to develop the automated script
- Build tool Maven is used for build, execution and dependency purpose
- TestNG Framework is used for organizing the scripts
- Page Object Model is the design pattern
- Test Data is read from Excel sheet at run time
- Git and Github is the version control management
- CI tool Jenkins is used to run the scripts
- Extent Spark Report test result are generated after each run


Why need a BaseClass?
- CodeReusability
- Scalability : Easy to maintain
- Centralized control
- Foundation for Test execution
